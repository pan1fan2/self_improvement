##### Project 3: Image classification using Tensorflow vis CNN+Transfer learning

Build a effective CNN model for image classification. The model adopts transfer learning approaches usesing features of a pre-trained network (VGG16) . 

The .py can be found in the [src](https://github.com/pan1fan2/self_improvement/tree/main/project3/src) folder
