The repo contains learning materials for self imporvement. 

##### [Project 1: Image classification using Pytorch via NN](https://github.com/pan1fan2/self_improvement/tree/main/project1)

Builid a image classifier using Pytroch and to classify cat and fish images but the current model only applies a simple neuro network

##### [Project 2: Image classification using Pytorch via CNN](https://github.com/pan1fan2/self_improvement/tree/main/project2)

CNN model vision of project 1, the cnn model is based on Alexnet

##### [Project 3: Image classification using Tensorflow vis CNN+Transfer learning](https://github.com/pan1fan2/self_improvement/tree/main/project3)

Build a effective CNN model for image classification. 

##### [Project 4 : Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using Pytorch](https://github.com/pan1fan2/self_improvement/tree/main/project4)

Learn and test a simple GAN model on Mnist
